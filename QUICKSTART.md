# ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide

## Welcome to DSA Studio!

This guide will help you get started with your new teaching tool in just 5 minutes.

## Step 1: Understanding the Interface

When you open the app, you'll see three main areas:

1. **Top Header**: View mode controls and session management
2. **Code Editor** (left): Where you write and run code
3. **Drawing Canvas** (right): Where you create visual diagrams

## Step 2: Write Your First Code

1. The editor opens with a sample Bubble Sort algorithm
2. Click the green **"Run"** button (or press `Ctrl+R`) to execute the code
3. View the output in the console at the bottom of the editor
4. Try modifying the code and running it again!

### Adding More Files

- Click the **"+"** button next to the file tabs
- Create multiple files for different algorithms
- Switch between tabs by clicking on them

## Step 3: Draw Your First Diagram

1. Look at the **Drawing Toolbar** above the canvas
2. Click on the **Pen** tool (or press `P`)
3. Choose a color from the color picker
4. Draw on the canvas!

### Try These Tools:

- **Rectangle** (`R`): Draw boxes for array elements
- **Circle** (`C`): Draw nodes for trees/graphs
- **Arrow** (`A`): Show connections and flow
- **Text** (`T`): Add labels and annotations

### Customize Your Drawing:

- **Stroke Width**: Adjust the line thickness (1-20px)
- **Fill Color**: Choose a fill for shapes
- **Line Style**: Solid, dashed, or dotted
- **Opacity**: Make elements semi-transparent

## Step 4: Master the View Modes

Click the buttons in the top header to switch views:

- **Split**: Best for live teaching (code + canvas)
- **Code**: Focus on coding
- **Draw**: Focus on drawing

**Pro Tip**: Use keyboard shortcuts!
- `Ctrl+1`: Split View
- `Ctrl+2`: Code Only
- `Ctrl+3`: Draw Only

### Resizable Panels

In Split View, drag the vertical divider between panels to resize them!

## Step 5: Save Your Work

1. Click the green **"Save"** button in the top right
2. Give your session a name (e.g., "Binary Search Tutorial")
3. Your entire workspace is saved (code + drawings + settings)

### Load a Previous Session

1. Click the **"Load"** button
2. Choose from your saved sessions
3. Everything is restored exactly as you left it!

## Advanced Tips

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Click the **blue keyboard icon** in the bottom-right corner to see all shortcuts.

Quick essentials:
- `Ctrl+Z`: Undo
- `Ctrl+Shift+Z`: Redo
- `Delete`: Delete selected elements
- Single letter keys: Quick tool switching (`P`, `R`, `C`, `A`, etc.)

### Exporting Your Work

**Export Canvas:**
- Click **"PNG"** to export as an image
- Click **"SVG"** to export as scalable vector graphics

**Export Code:**
- Click the download icon next to the Run button
- Code is saved with the proper file extension

**Export Session:**
- Click the download icon in the header
- Save as JSON file
- Import later to restore

### Undo/Redo

Made a mistake? No problem!
- **Undo**: `Ctrl+Z` (up to 50 steps back!)
- **Redo**: `Ctrl+Shift+Z` or `Ctrl+Y`

### Zoom & Pan

**Zoom:**
- Use the **+** and **-** buttons in the toolbar
- Current zoom level is shown between them
- Range: 25% to 400%

**Pan:**
- Click the **Hand** tool (or press `H`)
- Drag to move around the canvas
- Great for large diagrams!

## Teaching Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Live Coding Session

1. Use **Split View** mode
2. Write code on the left, explain with diagrams on the right
3. Run code to show output
4. Draw flow diagrams to visualize algorithm steps

### Scenario 2: Pre-prepared Lesson

1. Create your code and diagrams ahead of time
2. Save as a session
3. Load it during class
4. Make live modifications as you teach

### Scenario 3: Student Practice

1. Create a template with starter code
2. Export the session as JSON
3. Share with students
4. They can import and work on it

## Common Use Cases

### Visualizing Arrays

1. Use **Rectangle** tool to draw array cells
2. Use **Text** tool to add indices and values
3. Use **Arrow** to show pointers (left, right, mid)
4. Color-code to show sorted/unsorted regions

### Visualizing Trees

1. Use **Circle** tool for nodes
2. Use **Arrow** or **Line** for connections
3. Use **Text** for node values
4. Use colors to show traversal order

### Visualizing Graphs

1. Use **Circle** for vertices
2. Use **Arrow** for directed edges
3. Use **Line** for undirected edges
4. Use **Text** for weights and labels

### Explaining Algorithms

1. Write pseudocode or real code
2. Draw visual representation alongside
3. Use colors to highlight current step
4. Add text annotations to explain

## Troubleshooting

### Code won't run?
- Check the console for error messages (red text)
- Only JavaScript/TypeScript execution is supported in Phase 1
- Python, C++, Java support coming in Phase 2

### Drawing looks wrong?
- Use **Undo** (`Ctrl+Z`) to go back
- Use **Clear** to start fresh (with confirmation)
- Check that you've selected the right tool

### Session won't save?
- Make sure you give it a name
- Check browser localStorage isn't full
- Try exporting as JSON instead

### Can't find a feature?
- Check the keyboard shortcuts panel (blue keyboard icon)
- Some advanced features are planned for Phase 2+
- See the main README for the roadmap

## Next Steps

Now that you've learned the basics:

1. **Experiment**: Try all the tools and features
2. **Create Templates**: Build reusable sessions for common topics
3. **Practice**: Use it for your next DSA lesson
4. **Share**: Export and share your sessions with colleagues
5. **Provide Feedback**: Help make it better!
