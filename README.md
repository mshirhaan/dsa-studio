## üìñ Usage Guide

### Basic Workflow

1. **Start Coding**: 
   - Write your code in the editor
   - Click "Run" or press Ctrl+R to execute
   - View output in the console below

2. **Draw Diagrams**:
   - Select a tool from the drawing toolbar
   - Choose colors and stroke width
   - Draw on the canvas to visualize concepts

3. **Switch Views**:
   - Use the view mode buttons in the header
   - Or use keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+1/2/3)

4. **Save Your Work**:
   - Click "Save" to save your session
   - Give it a descriptive name
