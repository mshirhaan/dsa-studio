   - Use Split View for live demos
   - Color-code important elements
   - Save frequently

3. **Share with Students**
   - Export sessions as JSON
   - Share code files
   - Provide templates for practice

4. **Build a Library**
   - Save reusable templates
   - Organize by topic
   - Maintain a template collection

## 🐛 Known Limitations (Phase 1)

### Current Limitations
- **Code Execution**: Only JavaScript/TypeScript (Python, C++, Java coming in Phase 2)
- **Selection**: Basic select tool (advanced selection in Phase 2)
- **Collaboration**: Single-user only (real-time collab in Phase 3)
- **Templates**: No built-in templates yet (coming in Phase 2)
- **Mobile**: Desktop optimized (mobile support in Phase 3)

### Workarounds
- For other languages: Write pseudocode and visualize logic
- For complex selections: Use undo/redo liberally
- For collaboration: Export/import JSON sessions
- For templates: Create and save your own
- For mobile: Use tablet with stylus for best experience
